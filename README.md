## Course Description

This course focuses on the Python programming language with specific
emphasis on engineering applications. The course consists of weekly 2 hour
lectures, a weekly 2-hour lab session, and take-home programming assignments.
Specific course topics include:

* **Review.** A review of Python fundamentals including name binding,
  lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, iterators, functions, docstrings,
  exceptions, name spaces, file I/O, modules, and basic classes.

* **Git Introduction.** [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) is a powerful
  distributed source control and versioning system that has found
  ubiquitous use in both commercial and open-source project development.
  Students will learn how to `init`, `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `checkout`,
  `revert`, `reset`, `rebase`, `merge`, `fetch`, `pull`, and `push`.

* **Inheritance and polymorphism.** Object oriented programming offers
  powerful methods of code reuse and organization.  Here we will discuss
  how to factor out code common amongst classes to create base classes that
  can be used to create more specific sub-classes.

* **Optparse.** Build *real* terminal applications that have robust command
  line interfaces built on top of the `optparse` library.  All programming
  assignments in this class require that you utilize `optparse`.

* **Doctest.** Learn how to write docstrings that provide both usage examples
  as well as unit testing.

* **NumPy.** Serious scientific and engineering work in Python is done
  using [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org).  Native Python lists are slow and
  not well suited for solving large linear algebra problems or work with
  large discrete datasets.  Here, we will add [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)
  to our list of import libraries -- adding some serious octane to our
  numerical programs.

* **Numerical Derivaties & Integrals.** Learn how to numerically compute
  derivatives and integrals on empirically obtained data where the analytic
  expression is unknown.

* **Optimization.** Learn how to solve simple optimization problems using
  the gradient descent optimization method.

* **Monte Carlo Simulations.**

* **Simulated Annealing.**

* **Machine Learning.** Students will learn how to solve simple regression
  and classification problems using machine learning tools provided by the
  [scikit-learn](http://www.scikit-learn.org) module.
