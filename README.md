## Course Description

This course focuses on the application of the Python programming language
with specific emphasis on engineering applications. The course additionally
includes a weekly 2-hour lab session, a weekly take-home assignment, and
independent programming projects.

* **Review.** A review of Python fundamentals including name binding,
  lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, iterators, functions, docstrings,
  exceptions, name spaces, file I/O, modules, and basic classes.

* **Inheritance and polymorphism.**

* **Optparse.** Build "real" terminal applications that have robust command
  line interfaces built on top of the `optparse` library.  All programming
  assignments in this class require that you utilize `optparse`.

* **Doctest.** Learn how to write docstrings that provide both usage examples
  as well as unit testing.

* **NumPy.** Serious scientific and engineering work in Python is done
  using `NumPy`.  Native Python lists are slow and not well suited for
  solving large linear algebra problems or work with large discrete
  datasets.  Here, we will add `NumPy` to our list of import libraries --
  adding some serious octane to our numerical programs.

* **Numerical Derivaties & Integrals.** Learn how to numerically compute
  derivatives and integrals on empirically obtained data where the analytic
  expression is unknown.

* **Optimization.** Provides an introduction for how to solve simple
  optimization problems using gradient descent.

* **Monte Carlo Simulations.**

* **Simulated Annealing.**

* **Machine Learning.**
